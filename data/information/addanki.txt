# Addanki: The Municipal Town's Glimpse

## Geography

## History
Addanki has a rich historical background as it was the capital of the Reddi kingdom, founded by Prolaya Vema in 1325 AD. The kingdom flourished under his rule and that of his son Anavotha Reddy until 1355 AD, after which the capital was shifted to Kondaveedu. This historical significance has shaped Addanki's identity over the centuries.

## Addanki Inscription
One of the important artifacts of Addanki is the inscription near the Thousand Pillar Temple. This inscription serves as a testament to the flourishing Telugu literature that existed long before contemporary texts. It narrates the Boya campaign and highlights the military victories of Pandaranga, who was rewarded with land by Gunaga Vijayaditya III for his achievements. Notably, Pandaranga was a scholar-poet who translated Sanskrit works into Telugu, marking a significant milestone in the evolution of the Telugu language.

## Ancient Temples
- **1000 Stambala Temple:** Though destroyed, this temple holds great significance in local history as it was once the most important landmark near Bhavani Center Junction.
- **Sri Prasannajayaneya Swamy Temple:** Located on the Ongole-Hyderabad Highway, about 5 kilometers from the Addanki Bus stop, this temple is a sacred site for the local populace.
