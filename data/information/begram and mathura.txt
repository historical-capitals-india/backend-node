# Bagram: The Crossroads of Empires

Situated 60 km north of Kabul, at the confluence of the Ghorband and Panjshir Valleys, Bagram has been an important crossroads on the old Silk Road. Positionally, it was the point of access between Ancient India and the West. Scarcely crossing the Kushan Pass, travelers and merchants alike passed over towards Balkh and beyond. Merchants, monks, military convoys, and others have trod along these routes in circuits of empires risen and fallen, with layers to Bagram's very historical narrative.

**Do You Know?** Historic Bagram, known then as Kapisi, was a cross-cultural interface where various influences of Indians, Persians, Greeks, and even Chinese were witnessed.

## The Climate of Bagram: Contrasts in the Hindu Kush

It swings from one extreme to another: sizzling hot summers, biting cold winters—the robust Hindu Kush mountains hover over it. Temperatures up here often range above 100 degrees in the summer, and below freezing during the winter months. However, because of its height, dust and sand storms are frequent, and the winter snow blankets the area. As a result, Bagram is exposed to extreme contrasts—the landscapes that have challenged and kept many who settled here safe.

**Weather Fact:** Bagram falls into the Köppen category of hot-summer humid continental and has relatively short winters but freezing temperatures, with rainfall between October and April.

## Very Early Foundations: Kapisa to the Kushan Empire's Capital

Bagram's history can be traced back to Ancient Kapisa, a confluence of Buddhist and Hindu culture run by local rulers who integrated migrant Iranians. Indeed, Bagram was influenced over centuries by successive powers, which eventually transformed into the Kushan Kingdom's capital in the 1st century CE—the high trade era of the Silk Road.

**Historical Highlight:** The immigration of Kamboja tribes from Bactria gave a distinct cultural and religious influence melting into one when they settled in Kapisa (modern Bagram).

## The Mauryan Impact: Introducing Ashokan Buddhism

It came under the authority of the Mauryan Empire in 305 BCE after a short war between Chandragupta Maurya and Seleucus I. The former had ceded the two areas of Gandhara and Arachosia to the Mauryans. Buddhism spread to this area rapidly through the influence of Ashoka. It became an almost Buddhist spiritual center during the Mauryan period and saw growth in the development of Buddhist monasteries and stupas along with Zoroastrianism and local pagan cults.

**Imagine This:** Picture the busy town center where Buddhist monks and Mauryan officials discuss philosophy, law, and spirituality and help give Bagram an early identity as a cultural confluence.

## Capital of the Kushan Empire: Treasure and Commerce

The rise of the Kushan Empire in the 1st century CE turned Bagram into a rich capital, known for the Begram treasure—luxury goods that perfectly reflect the features of the strong cultural exchange between East and West. Finds like Roman glass, Indian ivories, and Chinese lacquer were discovered here, which gives testimony to the significance of Bagram as an important node of east-west trade. Such riches testify to Bagram as being a political center but also a center of artistic and commercial synergy.

**Explore More:** Imagine the markets of Kushan-era Bagram with merchants selling everything from this end of the ancient world to that.

## The Spread of Islam: A New Era of Conquest

The arrival of Islam in the country in the 7th century was a watershed moment in the cultural and religious landscape of Bagram. By the time the Ghaznavid dynasty had arrived in the 10th century, the majority of people were already Muslims. Ancient temples and Buddhist stupas increasingly gave way to mosques and madrasas, proving a critical cultural turning point in the history of the region.

**Fact:** Babur—the founder of the Mughal Empire, is said to have established the modern town of Bagram. In his memoirs known as *Baburnama*, he referred to a colony of Hindu ascetics living here, particularly at Gurh Kattri.

## Bagram of Today: The Cold War and the US Military Center

Again, Bagram's strategic position was put in view when the Bagram Airfield was constructed in 1976. It became a forward operating base for the Soviet forces when they invaded Afghanistan from 1979 to 1989, then it became the primary forward operating base for U.S. forces in Afghanistan. Equipped with a long runway and supporting infrastructure, Bagram Airfield played a key role in logistical and air support operations up to 2021.

In parallel with Bagram, Parwan Detention Facility held detainees, which garnered much attention in human rights and international law debates.

**Historical Note:** While stationed in this region, Bagram Airfield had a Provincial Reconstruction Team working in coordination with other efforts to stabilize and restore the local infrastructure.

## Bagram Today: Symbol of Resilience and Change

Bagram's history continued when the U.S. left in July 2021—a last act in a historical book. The Afghan government received control over the airfield in a furtive nighttime exit. Today Bagram is a testament to complex history—one that represents layers of history, starting from ancient capitals to a modern geopolitical center.

## Legacy in the Making

Even as recent events reshape Bagram's future, its history as a place of continuous strategic importance endures. For today's travelers, the remains of ancient Kapisa offer a direct link to Afghanistan's dynamic cultural heritage.
