## Patna: A City Striding from Ancient Times into Modernity
Patna is the capital of Bihar in India, one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, merging an ancient legacy with modern advancement. Historically known as Pataliputra, it has been a cradle of Indian culture, politics, and trade for thousands of years. Situated on the banks of the Ganges, it is the largest city in Bihar, housing important spiritual centers alongside Buddhist, Hindu, and Jain pilgrimage sites like Vaishali, Rajgir, and Bodh Gaya.

## Etymology and Ancient Names
The etymology of the name Patna is attributed to the local Hindu goddess, Patan Devi, or derived from a "tree called Patli" that exists here. The name has evolved over time, starting with Pataligrama, Pataliputra, Kusumapura, Padmavathi, and now Azimabad. Through these changes, the identity of the city has transformed significantly.

## Formation and Development in Early Times (490 BCE)
Patna was founded by the king of Magadha around 490 BCE as a strategic base to protect against rival states. Gautama Buddha passed through here, foreseeing a future that would be both prosperous and troublesome. The city flourished as Pataliputra under various dynasties and served as the capital for empires like the Nandas, Mauryas, Guptas, and Palas. It became a hub of knowledge, nurturing some of the greatest minds, including Aryabhata and Chanakya.

## Golden Period: Mauryan Era
During the Mauryan era, Pataliputra reached its zenith. It is claimed that the population was around 400,000. The Greek ambassador Megasthenes portrayed it as an extensive and fortified city beside the Ganges. It became the epicenter of Buddhist preaching, boasting architectural marvels like Agam Kuan, a gigantic well that still exists.

## Later Dynasties and Cultural Developments
Under the Shunga and Gupta dynasties, Patna continued to thrive as an attractive center for scholars and travelers. The Chinese monk Faxian noted its abundance and the presence of numerous hospitals for the needy. However, the fall of the Gupta Empire during the 12th century led to a decline, as the city was completely devastated by the Delhi Sultanate.

## Middle Age and Mughal Period
During the Mughal period, the city was renamed Azimabad. The revival began in the 16th century with Sher Shah Suri, and Emperor Akbar further developed it as a trading hub for rice, paper, glass, and other products that found their way to Europe. Sikh guru pilgrimage centers also became significant in Patna, especially after the birth of Guru Gobind Singh in the 10th house of Sikh gurus.

## Colonial Era and Economic Bloom
In the 17th century, British, French, and Dutch traders established factories in Patna, making it a center for saltpetre trade. The British officially annexed the city after the Battle of Buxar in 1764. Until 1912, it served as the capital of the Bihar and Orissa Province, acquiring administrative status.

## Contemporary Development and Economic Prosperity
Patna has remained the capital of Bihar after India gained independence in 1947. Even after the partition with Jharkhand, the city continued to develop steadily. Today, Patna is one of the fastest-growing cities in India, with a high per capita GDP and favorable conditions for starting businesses. The city's legacy of resilience continues as it bridges its glorious past with a vibrant future.

## Notable Landmarks and Cultural Significance
Modern Patna is home to heritage sites such as Golghar granary, Patna Sahib Gurudwara, and the historic Patan Devi Temple. It seamlessly weaves historical depth with modern urban expansion, inspiring further as a cultural and economic powerhouse in eastern India.
