# Agra

## Introduction to Agra
Agra is a city along the Yamuna River in Uttar Pradesh, located about 230 kilometers southeast of Delhi. Characterized by its rich history and cultural effervescence, Agra is home to the Taj Mahal, a significant attraction within India's tourist circuit known as the Golden Triangle, along with Delhi and Jaipur. With a population of about 1.6 million, it is the fourth largest city in Uttar Pradesh, renowned for its Mughlai cuisine, historical monuments, and goods from the leather industry.

## Origins and Etymology
There are several explanations for the origin of the name "Agra." The most widely accepted etymology refers to the Hindi word "agar," which translates to "salt-pan," alluding to the brackish soil in the area. Another version relates it to the Sanskrit word "agra," meaning "first" or "foremost." During the Mughal period, the city was also known as Akbarabad, named by Shah Jahan in commemoration of his grandfather, Emperor Akbar.

## Early History and Foundations
The ancient city lies on the eastern bank of the Yamuna, with origins tracing back to the mythological times of Krishna's life. The important city as we view it today was established by Sikandar Lodi in 1504 on the western bank of the river, becoming a significant seat of Islamic learning and later a royal residence.

## The Mughal Golden Age
Agra's golden age began with the Mughals in 1526, when Babur annexed the city after winning the First Battle of Panipat over the Lodhis. Under successive emperors like Akbar, Jahangir, and Shah Jahan, Agra emerged as the magnificent capital of the Mughal Empire. Akbar built Agra Fort, while Shah Jahan, in memory of his beloved Mumtaz Mahal, constructed the Taj Mahal, now one of the Seven Wonders of the World.

## Architectural Marvels: Agra Fort and Taj Mahal
The Agra Fort, a UNESCO World Heritage site, embodies Mughal military ingenuity with its massive red sandstone walls and intricate palaces. The Taj Mahal stands nearby as an eternal symbol of love and architectural elegance, blending Persian, Indian, and Islamic styles in its white marble façade, gardens, and minarets. This masterpiece took 22 years and thousands of artisans to complete, attracting millions of visitors from around the world.

## Maratha and British Rule
With the declining power of the Mughals in the 18th century, Agra was captured first by the Marathas, then the Jats, before it eventually came under the British East India Company in 1803. The British made infrastructural changes to turn the city into an important center of railway transportation and administration for the North-Western Provinces, a role it held until 1858. Major events of the Indian Rebellion of 1857, such as the Battle of Agra, occurred in the city; however, the mutiny was relatively minor compared to events in other parts of the country.

## Role of Agra in Independence Movement and Beyond
Agra contributed little to the independence movement, but it was a hub for Hindi and Urdu journalism leading up to independence. After 1947, Agra evolved into an industrial center, with a significant footprint in the footwear and leather industries. Its tourism sector has since flourished, alongside its Mughlai cuisine, bustling bazaars, and lasting cultural heritage, ensuring Agra remains an integral part of India's historical and cultural landscape.

## Present Day Agra
Today, Agra combines industrial advancement with its rich heritage. The climate ranges from mild winters to hot, dry summers, with monsoon rains. For those traveling the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc, Agra presents a captivating blend of the old and the new—UNESCO-famed sites, vibrant local arts, and historic reverence abound.
