# Gauḍa

## 1. Gauḍa in Historical Perspective
Gauḍa, also known as Gaur, Gour, Lakhnauti, Lakshmanavati, and Jannatabad, was one of the highly significant historical cities of Bengal in the eastern Indian subcontinent. It is one of the most important capitals of classical and medieval India, being the capital city of Bengal under several kingdoms. The Gauḍa region was also a province of many pan-Indian empires. Founded in the seventh century by King Shashanka, whose reign coincides with the commencement of the Bengali calendar, Gauda gradually came to be identified with Bengal and Bengalis. It was conquered by Bakhtiyar Khalji, a lieutenant of the Ghurid ruler Muhammad of Ghori in 1203.

## 2. The Rise of Gauda as a Capital
Gauda was the capital of the Bengal Sultanate between 1453 and 1565, a period of 112 years. In 1500, Gauda was the fifth-most populous city in the world with a population of 200,000 and one of the most densely populated cities in the Indian subcontinent. The Portuguese left behind vivid accounts of the city. Sultans designed a citadel as well as many mosques, a royal palace, canals, and bridges. Buildings sported glazed tiles.

## 3. Fall of Gauda
The town flourished until the fall of the Bengal Sultanate in the 16th century when the Mughal Empire conquered the region. During the invasion of the region by the Mughal Emperor Humayun, he conferred the name Jannatabad ("heavenly city") to the town. Most of the existing buildings in Gauda date back to the time of the Bengal Sultanate. The town was captured by Sher Shah Suri. An epidemic of the plague further hastened the fall of the city. Its strategic importance was first lost when the course of the Ganges was once located near it, but when the river's course was changed, Gauda lost its strategic importance. A new Mughal capital developed later in Rajmahal and then in Dhaka.

## 4. Gauda's Architectural Heritage
Gauda was one of the most brilliant capitals in the history of Bengal and in the history of the Indian subcontinent, and a center of stately medieval architecture. Gauda's ruins were featured in the work of European painters in the 18th and 19th centuries. Colonial officers, including Francis Buchanan-Hamilton and William Francklin, have bequeathed us minute surveys of the former Bengali capital.

## 5. The Kingdom of Gauda
After the fall of the Gupta Empire, western Bengal was under Gauda Kingdom and eastern Bengal was under Samatata Kingdom. Gauda was established by Shashanka, one of the pioneering Bengal kings ever. Shashanka's reign is believed to be about between 590 and 625.

## 6. The Pala Empire
The Pala Empire was founded in the region of Gauda when Gopala rose to kingship with the sanction of an assembly of chieftains. Pala Emperors styled themselves as Lords of Gauda. The empire lasted for four hundred years, and its area covered much of northern India. D. C. Sicar, a historian, says the term Gauda is a suitable denomination for the Pala Empire itself. Bengali language, script, and everything pertaining to the culture of Bengal gradually developed in the period of Pala. Indeed, the term Gaudiya (of Gauda) became synonymous with Bengal and Bengalis.

## 7. The Sena Dynasty
Gauda became known as Lakhnauti during the Sena dynasty. The name was in honour of the Sena ruler Lakhsman Sena.

## 8. The Delhi Sultanate
On a campaign towards Tibet in 1206, Bakhtiyar left Shiran Khalji to govern Bengal as a surrogate. Bakhtiyar would die after the failure of this expedition, officially leaving Shiran as the next governor of Lakhnauti, who would shortly be succeeded by Ali Mardan Khalji and Iwaz Khalji. The latter would declare independence from Delhi, which would also lead to his death.

## 9. Independent Lakhnauti
Historians have it that in 1281, Nasiruddin Bughra Khan declared the independence of Lakhnauti from the Sultanate of Delhi. His son, Rukunuddin Kaikaus, succeeded him and enlarged his kingdom. In his rule, the Lakhnauti-based kingdom expanded into Satgaon in the south, Bihar in the west, and Devkot in the north. His successor was Shamsuddin Firuz Shah, who played pivotal roles in completing Kaikaus' work in Satgaon before proceeding to take over Mymensingh and Sonargaon. In 1303, Firuz's nephew Sikandar Khan Ghazi and commander-in-chief Syed Nasiruddin teamed up with Shah Jalal and his forces in the Conquest of Sylhet against the Gour Kingdom. Sylhet was successfully incorporated into Firuz's Lakhnauti kingdom. His successor Ghiyasuddin Bahadur Shah would lose his independence to the Delhi Sultanate once again.

## 10. The Bengal Sultanate
Gauda was known largely by the name Gaur under the Bengal Sultanate. The founder of the sultanate was Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah who was the governor of Delhi in Satgaon. Ilyas Shah revolted and deprived Gaur's governor Alauddin Ali Shah in 1342. Ilyas Shah consolidated the Bengal region as a distinct independent state independent of Delhi in 1352. Pandua remained the first capital of the sultanate. In 1450, the Sultan Mahmud Shah of Bengal declared that the capital of Bengal was being shifted from Pandua to Gaur. The transfer was completed by 1453. Gaur was the capital of the Bengali sultanate for over a century till 1565.

## 11. Town Planning in Gaur
Gaur was one of the most thickly populated towns in the Indian subcontinent, whose population stood second to none, not even Fatehpur Sikri. The city had a citadel, a royal palace and durbar, innumerable mosques, residences of nobles and merchants, and bazaars. The Portuguese travelers have left detailed and comprehensive accounts of Gaur. The Portuguese compared the affluence of the city with Lisbon. The royal palace was divided into three compartments. A high wall enclosed the palace. A moat surrounded the palace on three sides and was connected to the Ganges, which guarded the western side of the citadel. A Vaishnava poet writing during the contemporariness of Alauddin Hussain Shah has recorded that one day, while standing on the opposite bank of the Ganges, the latter caught a glimpse of Sri Chaitanya's procession. The north compartment consists of the durbar. An inscription by Sultan Rukunuddin Barbak Shah speaks of a fountain and water channel situated midway from the Dakhil Darwaza gate. This gate exists even today. The Portuguese and the medieval Bengali poet Krittibas Ojha describe the nine gates on the road from Dakhil Darwaza to the durbar, of which two can be seen today. The second division was the living space of the Sultan, where glazed tiles in various colours added to their beauty. The third compartment was the harem. Many artefacts have been unearthed from the palace complex, including enamelled bricks and Chinese porcelain. A Portuguese visitor in 1521 reported that Sultan Nusrat Shah watched polo being played in a match on the plains below the citadel. Gaur was the capital of regional politics. The former Arakanese king Min Saw Mon was provided with asylum in Gaur. The Sultan of Bengal sent a military expedition from Gaur to achieve the Reconquest of Arakan.

## 12. Trade and Cultural Exchange
The Portuguese historian Castenhada de Lopez described the houses of Gaur. Most buildings were one-storeyed with ornamental floor tiles, courtyards, and gardens. There were canals and bridges. Bengal attracted many Eurasian merchants during the Sultanate period, and Gaur was a centre of trade like other erstwhile Bengali cities, including Pandua, Chittagong, Sonargaon, and Satgaon. Bengal also attracted immigrants from North India, the Middle East, and Central Asia.

## 13. Mughal Occupation and Decline
In the 16th century, Gaur was invaded by the Mughal emperor Humayun who wished to call it Jannatabad (heavenly city). Sher Shah Suri's invasion also plundered and ransacked the city. After 1565, Sultan Sulaiman Khan Karrani moved the capital to Tandah. In 1575, Gaur was seized by a Mughal contingent under Munim Khan. The Bengal Sultanate came to an end in the Battle of Rajmahal in 1576.

## 14. Contributions to Architecture by Mughals
A few buildings were constructed during the Mughal period in Gaur. The two-storeyed Mughal Tahakhana complex was a viceregal resting place. Tahkhana in Persian means a building with a cool environment. In addition, the name asserts that this complex had an indoor ventilation system to average the often humid temperatures. It is also said that the Sufi khanqah was situated within this complex. Lukochori Darwaza or hide and seek gate were built at the entrance of the road towards the complex. The construction of these buildings is said to have been done by the hands of the viceroy Shah Shuja. The outbreak of the plague and a twist in the Ganges caused the city
