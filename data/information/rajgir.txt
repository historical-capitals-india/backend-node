# Rajgir: The City of Kings

Rajgir, originally known as Rajagriha, meaning "The City of Kings," holds a prominent place in ancient Indian history. It was the first capital of the kingdom of Magadha, a state that later evolved into the powerful Mauryan Empire. This ancient city is located in modern-day Nalanda district in Bihar, India, and has deep connections with Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.

## Early Origins

### Founding
The city's founding is often attributed to Brihadratha, a ruler of the Brihadratha dynasty, around 2000 BCE, though its exact origin remains uncertain. Archaeological findings, like ceramics dating back to 1000 BCE, suggest its antiquity.

### Cyclopean Wall
One of the oldest landmarks in Rajgir is the 2,500-year-old cyclopean wall, signifying its early strategic importance as a fortified city.

## Haryanka Dynasty

### Rajgir as Capital
Rajgir was the capital under the Haryanka dynasty in the 6th century BCE, during the reign of King Bimbisara (558–491 BCE) and his son, Ajatashatru (492–460 BCE).

- **Bimbisara**: A key figure during this period, he was a contemporary of both Gautama Buddha and Mahavira. He expanded the kingdom of Magadha and played an important role in the early development of Buddhism, even offering a forest monastery (Venuvana) to Buddha.
- **Ajatashatru**: He fortified Rajgir by building new walls and extended the kingdom's influence but also imprisoned his father, Bimbisara. His reign saw frequent interactions with Buddha, and Rajgir continued to be an important center for Buddhist teachings.

## Religious Significance

### Buddhism
Gautama Buddha spent many months in Rajgir, meditating and delivering key sermons. Vulture’s Peak in Rajgir became one of his most famous preaching locations. The First Buddhist Council was held here in the Saptaparni Cave after Buddha’s death.

### Jainism
Rajgir is equally important for Jainism, as Mahavira, the 24th Jain Tirthankara, spent 14 years in Rajgir. It is believed that the 20th Tirthankara, Munisuvrata, was also born here.

## Shishunaga Dynasty

After the decline of the Haryanka dynasty, the Shishunaga dynasty took over in 413 BCE, and Rajgir remained the capital initially. However, King Udayin, the son of Ajatashatru, eventually shifted the capital to Pataliputra (modern-day Patna), signaling the decline of Rajgir's political prominence.

## Mauryan Empire

Rajgir's legacy continued under the Mauryan dynasty, even though its role as the capital had diminished. The nearby city of Nalanda later rose in importance under the Mauryas, especially during the reign of Emperor Ashoka, a devout follower of Buddhism who built stupas and monasteries in and around Rajgir.

## Later Dynasties and Influence

Over time, Rajgir remained a center of pilgrimage, deeply associated with Buddhism, Jainism, and Hinduism. It is mentioned in various scriptures, including the Mahabharata, where it is called **Girivraja**, and is associated with Jarasandha, a king of Magadha and an adversary of the Pandavas.

## Key Historical Figures and Events

- **King Bimbisara**: Helped establish Rajgir as a major city during the 6th century BCE.
- **Ajatashatru**: Continued his father's work but moved the capital to Pataliputra.
- **Gautama Buddha**: Preached extensively in Rajgir, and the First Buddhist Council was held here.
- **Mahavira**: Spent a significant part of his life in Rajgir, making it a sacred place for Jains.
- **Jarasandha**: A powerful king mentioned in the Mahabharata.

## Rajgir Today

Rajgir continues to be a site of immense historical and religious significance. The **Vishwa Shanti Stupa**, built in 1969, and other Buddhist and Jain monuments attract pilgrims from around the world.
