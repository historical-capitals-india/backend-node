# Kolkata: A Cultural and Historical Overview

Kolkata, until 2001 known as Calcutta, is the capital and largest city of the Indian state of West Bengal. Situated on the eastern side of the Hooghly River, Kolkata is roughly 80 km from the border with Bangladesh. It is a prime commercial and financial hub of eastern and northeastern India, with an approximately 4.5 million city population and metropolitan populations over 15 million, making it one of India's most populous metropolitan cities. Kolkata is often referred to as the "cultural capital of India," reflecting its deep historical and cultural roots.

## Early History and Founding

Kolkata is said to have originated in three villages under the Mughal Nawab of Bengal named Kalikata, Sutanuti, and Govindapur. In 1690, the British East India Company was granted these villages as a trade base, leading to the establishment of Fort William. After the Battle of Plassey in 1757, the British East India Company took control of the city and made Calcutta the de facto capital of British India until 1911. Rapidly, the city grew administratively and culturally, eventually becoming the second-largest city within the British Empire after London.

## British Era and Cultural Renaissance

During the British period, Kolkata became a hub of politics, law, education, and arts. It served as the main center for the Bengali Renaissance, which spurred cultural, literary, and intellectual development throughout India. At the turn of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Kolkata was also the center of the Indian independence movement, marked by revolutionary activities and nationalist gatherings.

## Post-independence Challenges

The partition of Bengal in 1947 had a profound impact on Kolkata, leading to waves of Hindu refugees pouring into the city from East Bengal, now Bangladesh. During the Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971, the government-in-exile of Bangladeshi people settled in Kolkata, further complicating the socio-political landscape of the city. The economic downturn of the 1960s and 1970s, coupled with rising political unrest and growing Naxalite movements, hindered the city's growth and development.

## Cultural Importance

The culture of Kolkata is a unique blend of colonial architecture, localities known as **paras**, and informal discussion groups called **adda**. Notable landmarks include the Victoria Memorial, Howrah Bridge, and India's only Chinatown. The Durga Puja festival is celebrated with great fervor and has been recognized as a UNESCO heritage event, earning Kolkata the title of "City of Joy."

## Contemporary Economy and Education

Kolkata is home to various institutions of national importance, including the University of Calcutta, the Asiatic Society, and the Indian Museum. It is also the hub of Tollywood, the Bengali film industry. Since the 1990s, the city's economy has experienced a rebirth, with growth in the IT sector, manufacturing, and various service industries. Kolkata remains one of India's oldest operating ports, serving as an economic gateway.

## Etymology

The name "Kolkata" comes from the Bengali name "Kôlikata," one of the original villages. The meaning of this name is often debated; one theory suggests it derives from "Kalikkhetrô," or a field of the goddess Kali, while another links it to the nearby Kalighat temple. Some believe it comes from Bengali terms describing flatlands or canals.
