# Bhinmal

## Bhinmal (Shrimal Nagar)
Bhinmal is an ancient town located in the Jalore District of Rajasthan, India. Situated 72 km south of Jalore, it is considered the early capital of the mighty kingdom of Gurjaradesa, which covered the southern parts of Rajasthan and northern parts of Gujarat. The town is notable as the birthplace of many legendary figures, including the great Sanskrit poet Magha and the renowned mathematician-astronomer Brahmagupta.

## Historical Background
Originally known as Bhillamala, Bhinmal's earlier name was Srimal, from which the Shrimali Brahmins derived their name. According to the Chinese Buddhist pilgrim Xuanzang, who traversed India between 631 and 645 AD during the reign of King Harsha, the town was referred to as Pi-lo-mo-lo. Scholars have proposed different etymologies for its name, suggesting it may have originated from its Bhil population or from the depredation caused by Islamic invasions that forced migration from the region.

Bhinmal served as the capital of the Gurjaradesa kingdom, with its first mention appearing in Banabhatta's *Harshacharita* in the seventh century AD. Xuanzang noted that this kingdom was the second largest in Western India, with a territorial extent of about 833 miles, governed by a young Kshatriya king known for his wisdom and courage.

## Influence of Islamic Invasions
Bhinmal's strategic location attracted Islamic conquerors, including Muhammad bin Qasim and Junayd, who invaded the town in the early 8th century. Following their campaigns, the town was annexed by Arabs for a time. During this period, around 730 AD, a new dynasty emerged under Nagabhata I, who is credited with repelling the Arab forces and reestablishing regional power.

## Emergence of the Pratihara Kingdom
The Pratihara dynasty, which sprouted from Nagabhata, became the most powerful ruler in Rajasthan and Gujarat, eventually extending into a large empire established in Kannauj. Raja Man Pratihar ruled Bhinmal during the invasion of the Parmara Emperor Vakpati Munja in the later 10th century, and the conquests were divided among his princes. Raja Devalsimha Pratihar attempted to regain Pratihara influence over Bhinmal but had to settle in the surrounding regions.

## Shrimala and Cultural Significance
Historically known as Shrimala, Bhinmal was an important center for cultural and economic activities, particularly for the Shrimali Brahmanas and Shrimali Vaniyas. The symbolic seat of these communities moved to Patan when Vanaraja Chavda established a new capital there, and the main image of Mahalakshmi from Bhinmal was transferred to Patan in 1147.

### Śrīmali Clan
The Śrīmali clan is a branch of the Vanicker community from Gujarat and is listed among the 36 Other Backward Classes (OBC) in Gujarat. The clan is attributed to the influential Jain monk Acharya Swayamprabhasuri, who arrived in Bhinmal around 470 BCE. His teachings on non-violence were well-received by the local populace, leading many citizens to convert to Jainism. Swayamprabhasuri not only transformed the religious life of Bhinmal but also facilitated the migration of the Śrīmali community throughout Rajasthan, establishing a strong legacy for the town.
