# Shimla

## History

The name "Shimla" is believed to derive from "Shyamalaya," meaning 'blue house' in English—referring to a solitary slate blue construction on Jakhu Hill, built by a fakir. Another theory suggests that it originates from "Shyamala" or "Shamli," referring to Goddess Kali, for whom a temple, the well-known Kali Bari Temple, is still located near Rothney Castle. A 2018 proposal to rename Shimla to "Shyamala" was dismissed after public feedback.

## Historical Background

Originally a dense forestland with scattered settlements, British establishment in Shimla began in the early 19th century after the Anglo-Nepalese War (1814–16) under the Treaty of Sugauli. The cool Himalayan climate attracted British officers to build in Shimla, starting with the cottage of Charles Pratt Kennedy in 1822. By 1864, Shimla became the summer capital of the British Raj. Many important political events occurred in Shimla, including the Simla Deputation (1906), Simla Accord (1914), and Simla Conference (1945).

## Colonial Development and Significance

Shimla evolved into a hill station known for its colonial architecture and vibrant social life. Notable buildings include Christ Church, Viceregal Lodge, and Town Hall. Roads and infrastructure, such as the 560-foot long Dhalli Tunnel, were developed to enhance the area. The British established elite schools and built the Kalka–Shimla Railway line, which is now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

## Political Relevance After Independence

Shimla served as the temporary state capital of East Punjab until the formation of Himachal Pradesh State in 1948. It became the state capital once again when Himachal became a state in 1971. The 1972 Simla Agreement was signed in the state, marking an important era of international diplomatic history and cooperation between India and Pakistan.

## Architecture and Cultural Heritage

Shimla is adorned with interesting buildings from the Tudor, neo-Gothic, and colonial eras, situated alongside temples and churches. Key attractions include Jakhu Temple dedicated to Hanuman, cultural centers like Mall Road and The Ridge, the Shri Hanuman Jakhu statue, Viceregal Lodge, and the scenic Kalka–Shimla Railway route.

## Tourism and Modern Attractions

Shimla attracts tourists with its natural beauty, colonial architecture, and cultural sites. It hosts South Asia's largest mountain biking event, MTB Himalaya, and is home to the largest natural ice-skating rink in South Asia. As an educational center, it boasts numerous colleges and research institutions.

## Geography and Urban Layout

Shimla's city center extends from Jakhoo in the north to Annadale in the south, Sanjauli in the east, and Chotta Shimla in the west. Its rugged terrain, with steep hillsides and scenic vistas, shapes both the city's layout and its charm.
