# Panaji: Goa's Capital

## Overview
Panaji, also known as Panjim, is the capital city of the Indian state of Goa and serves as the headquarters of the North Goa district. Situated on the banks of the Mandovi River estuary, Panaji is characterized by terraced hills, red-tiled concrete buildings, and a lively riverside promenade. The name "Panaji" originates from the Konkani words "panjani," meaning "boat," and "khali," referring to a small creek. Historically, it was called Nova Goa or New Goa, as Velha Goa had become an old city that needed replacement as the capital of Portuguese India. The Portuguese termed it Pangim, and over time, in the 1980s, its modern spelling emerged.

Panaji was declared the capital of Portuguese India in the mid-18th century after a devastating epidemic in Velha Goa. The city was officially elevated to city status on 22 March 1843. When the Indian Union annexed Portuguese territories in 1961, Panaji became a state capital in 1987, and its political status was formalized in present-day Goa.
