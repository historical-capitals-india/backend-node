# Warangal and Hanamkonda: A Historical Overview

## History
Warangal is a city in the Indian state of Telangana and served as the capital of the Kakatiya dynasty from 1163 CE. The city's history is marked by architectural grandeur, with prominent kings such as Beta Raja I, who founded the Kakatiya dynasty, and Rani Rudrama Devi, the only woman to rule the Telugu region. The Kakatiyas significantly influenced the area, constructing monumental structures like Warangal Fort, the Thousand Pillared Temple, and the Swayambhu Temple. After the Kakatiyas were defeated by the Delhi Sultanate in 1323, the city was briefly known as Sultanpur under Juna Khan, before reverting to its original name, Orugallu, when the Musunuri Nayaks recovered it in 1336 CE.

Hanamkonda, situated north of Warangal, was the ancient capital of the Kakatiya kings before they moved to Warangal during Ganapati Deva's reign. The name "Hanamkonda" translates to "the hill of Hanuman." The city holds significant historical value, with one of its key structures being the Thousand Pillared Temple, constructed by King Rudra in 1163 CE, representing the pinnacle of Kakatiya architecture.

The Thousand Pillared Temple, located in Hanamkonda, is renowned for its stunning sculptures and intricate pillars. These monumental structures exemplify the Kakatiyas' contributions to art and architecture in the region, attracting visitors from across the country.

## Geography
Warangal spans over 406 square km and, along with Kazipet and Hanamkonda, forms the Tri City of Warangal. This tri-city is well-connected by National Highway 163, facilitating transit and trade. The historical geographical features, combined with rugged terrain and ancient fortifications, significantly influenced the region's status as a power center during the Kakatiya regime.

As an older capital, Hanamkonda plays a crucial role in Kakatiya history. Sites like the Thousand Pillared Temple serve as evidence of Warangal Tri-City's cultural wealth, contributing to Telangana's rich heritage.

## Etology
The name "Warangal" evolved from its earlier name, Orugallu, which means "single stone," referring to the granite boulder present in Warangal Fort. Other historical names include Ekashila Nagaram and Omatikonda, each reflecting its historical significance. The term "Warangal" is derived from the Sanskrit word "Ekasailanagara," which denotes rocky terrain.

The name "Hanamkonda" comes from the Sanskrit term "Hanumadachala," meaning "the hill of Hanuman," linking it to the mythical stories from the epic Ramayana and enriching its cultural depth within the region's historical identity.
