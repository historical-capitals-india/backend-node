# Pune: The Oxford of the East

## History
Pune, till recently known as Poona, has a rich history that includes the Rashtrakutas, Mughals, and Marathas. The city emerged as an important center during the development of the Maratha Empire in the 18th century, especially as it housed the seat of the Peshwas, the prime ministers of the empire. Pune was captured by the British East India Company in the Third Anglo-Maratha War in 1818, which changed its administrative power. The city also played a significant role in social reform and nationalism, with great leaders like Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Bal Gangadhar Tilak advocating for Indian freedom.

## Etymology
The earliest reference to Pune is found in an inscription of the Rashtrakuta dynasty from the year 937 CE, referring to it as *Punya-Vishaya*, which translates to "holy news." The city's name changed over time, adopting names like Punawadi and Punakavishaya. During British rule, the name "Poona" was commonly used until it officially became Pune in 1978. These name changes reflect the dynamic growth of the city throughout its history.

## Geography
Located in the Deccan Plateau, Pune sits at an altitude of 560 meters (1,840 feet) above sea level. The city is situated where the Mula and Mutha rivers meet, nestled behind the Sahyadri mountain range towards the Arabian Sea. This geographical positioning results in a moderate climate and rich biological diversity, making it an attractive place for residents and tourists alike.

## Architectural Heritage
Pune's architecture epitomizes its rich heritage, hosting notable buildings such as Shaniwar Wada, built in 1732, and Vishrambaug Wada, a great example of Maratha architecture. The city is also home to significant religious sites, including the Kasba Ganapati temple. As Pune faces the influences of modernity, old buildings exist alongside newer constructions, contributing to the city's evolving identity.

## Importance
Pune is often referred to as the "Oxford of the East" due to its prestigious higher educational institutions, such as Savitribai Phule Pune University, established in 1948. The city is a crucial IT and manufacturing hub, making substantial contributions to the Indian economy. Additionally, Pune's rich cultural life—with its festivals, arts, and literature—establishes it as a center for learning and innovation.
