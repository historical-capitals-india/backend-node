## History
Taxila was originally the capital of the ancient kingdom of Gandhāra and was one of the important trading centers and centers of learning. The city was founded around 1000 BCE, and later, it emerged as a key intersection of trade routes linking the Indian subcontinent with Central Asia. The city boasts a history of political and cultural importance as part of many empires that once existed: Achaemenid, Maurya, Indo-Greek, Indo-Scythian, and Kushan. It was conquered in 326 BCE by Alexander the Great and saw an ancient university being established that is one of the oldest universities in South Asia.

## Origins
The word "Taxila" is taken from the Sanskrit "Takṣaśilā," meaning "City of Cut Stone," and has connections with an anecdote in the Ramayana concerning the brother of Lord Rama, Bharata. Early on, the ancient Greek form of the name was commonly adopted.

## Early Settlements
Taxila is known to have originated from the Neolithic period. However, major settlement evidence dates from about 1000 BCE. It served as a commercial center that connected some of the neighboring regions, such as Puṣkalāvatī.
