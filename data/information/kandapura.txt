# Chejerla Village: History and Spirituality Mark the Way in Palnadu District

**Chejerla** is a voice of glorious history and religious fervor in the charming plains of the **Palnadu district**, Andhra Pradesh. Situated in **Nekarikallu Mandal** within the **Narasaraopet revenue division**, the village of Chejerla is witness to the grandeur of an ancient **Kapotheswara Temple** housing the typical Lord Shiva in the form of **Kapotheswara**, representing deep self-sacrifice in charity.

## The Kapotheswara Legend and the Story of King Sibhi

The **Kapotheswara Temple** dates back to the **4th or 5th century AD**, raised on a legend of pure charity. It is said that **King Sibhi Chakravarthi**—the great champion of charity—chose this site for his act of performing a **Siva Homam**. The divine trinity, the **Trimurti**, disguised themselves to test his devotion, assuming several forms: 
- Lord Brahma resembled a willow,
- Lord Vishnu took the form of a dove called **Kapotham**,
- Lord Shiva appeared as a hunter called **Boya**.

The dove sought refuge from the king, who agreed to sacrifice his flesh for its safety. When he was about to give his final piece, the gods revealed themselves, and moved by Sibhi's sacrifice, they granted him the boon he wanted. The king asked them to stay there, which is why the **Kapotheswara Linga** has the appearance of a headless torso with marks of self-sacrifice.

## Unique Features and Cultural Significance

The **Kapotheswara Temple** is not only a landmark in the religious category but also an architectural wonder. The Linga is said to embody the spirit of Sibhi's sacrifice, and locals believe that if it is not cleansed regularly, the Linga emits a smell known as "neesu," which represents living flesh. It remains an important pilgrimage center, attracting those who are drawn to stories of sacrifice, compassion, and duty. Additionally, the village is home to other shrines, such as the **Kshetra Palaka Hanuman Temple** and a temple dedicated to **Kumaraswamy**.

## Architectural Style and Buddhist Influence

The **Kapotheswara Temple** is constructed in a rare **apsidal (Hasti prasta)** style, resembling the architecture of early **Buddhist chaityas**. The apsidal layout, curved at one end, contains a marble Linga at its center. Historical records indicate that the complex was once a **Buddhist monastery**. The structure is a testament to a golden period of peace where Hindu elements of worship assimilated with Buddhism. This temple exemplifies architectural patterns similar to the **Ter Trivikrama Temple** of Maharashtra, proving the influence of Buddhism on early Hindu temples.

## Association with Buddhist and Jataka Tales

The legend of King Sibhi is also recounted in **Buddhist Jataka tales**, known as the **Sibi Jataka**. The tale exemplifies the highest **Raja Dharma**, or the duty of the king to protect all who take refuge there. Such bonds create ethical and moral traditions that connect Hinduism with Buddhism, highlighting the cultural assimilation and historical significance of the monument at Chejerla.

## Geographic and Spiritual Landscape

The natural serenity that pervades the rocky hills and scrub jungle of **Chejerla** makes the spiritual essence of the village evident. The blend of rugged terrain and ancient temples assures a serene landscape that attracts both pilgrims and travelers.

## Conservation and Community Support

There is a growing demand for more attention and support for the preservation of this rich cultural heritage, particularly regarding the temple and surrounding shrines. Restoration and maintenance efforts for Chejerla's **Kapotheswara Temple** would enable future generations to appreciate its unique place in Indian spirituality and architectural history.
