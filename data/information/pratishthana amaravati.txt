# Amaravathi: A Historical Village in Andhra Pradesh

**Amaravathi** is a village on the Krishna River, found in India's Capital Region within the Palnadu district of Andhra Pradesh. The small yet culturally rich town shares the name of the planned capital located nearby, Amaravati, an area 35 km east.

## Founding and Early Development

After the atrocities perpetrated by the British East India Company at Chintapalli, the ruler Raja Vasireddy Venkatadri Nayudu formed Amaravathi in the 1790s as the new capital for his kingdom. The village name is a tribute to the ancient **Amaravati Stupa**, a significant Buddhist site excavated in the process of building Amaravathi. Amaravathi is located near **Dhanyakataka**, which was once the **Satavahana** capital.

## Religious and Cultural Significance

This village is home to the sacred **Pancharama Kshetras** for Hindus and near it, the well-known **Amaravati Stupa** built in the period of 2nd century BCE - 3rd century CE. Close to the colossal **Dhyana Buddha** statue, a 21st-century installation, Amaravathi's legacy of Buddhism lives on. The town comes under the **HRIDAY scheme** initiated by India to preserve its historic cultural heritage.

## Historical Background

Historically, Amaravathi's name, meaning "Place of Immortals," was known as **Dhanyakataka** and **Andhranagari**. According to the **Kalachakra Tantra** tradition, Gautama Buddha visited this area long before the **Mauryan Empire** came there. Under the **Satavahana dynasty** rule (225 BCEâ€“229 CE), the eastern capital at Amaravathi flourished into a hub of Buddhist teachings and art. The exposure of the **Amaravati Stupa** in the 18th century reveals sculptures and carvings from different periods, showing its artistic history.

## Artistic Heritage: The Amaravati School of Art

The **Amaravati School of Art** created exceptionally beautiful Buddhist sculptures during the Satavahana era and extended to Sri Lanka. Buddha, Bodhisattva, and other figurative sculptures from Amaravathi are famous for their distinctive style, on par with the Gandhara and Mathura schools of art. **Monasteries** and **Amaravathi University** were well-known, attracting scholars from all parts of India and Southeast Asia. After the Satavahanas, the **Ikshvaku dynasty** also patronized the Buddhism of Amaravathi.

## Medieval and Colonial Period

Amaravathi is mentioned in the **Skanda Purana** for its **Shiva temple**. During British times, Amaravati's Buddhist relics were excavated by **Walter Elliot**, an East India Company officer. The **"Elliot Marbles"**, many of which are exhibited in the British Museum, are Amaravati Buddhist relics.

## Post-Independence and the Mahachaitya Stupa

Amaravathi's most important monument, upon which the **Archaeological Survey of India (ASI)** has built a temple, is the **Mahachaitya** or **Great Stupa**. The **Dalai Lama** performed **Kalachakra Mahasamalanam** at the site in 2006, emphasizing the continued spiritual importance of Amaravathi.

## Modern Amaravathi

Amaravathi covers 1,524 hectares and has a population of around 13,400 according to the 2011 Census. Under the jurisdiction of the **Amaravathi gram panchayat**, the village comes under the **Pedakurapadu constituency**. The **Amaralingeswara Temple**, established by Raja Vasireddy Venkatadri Nayudu, and the **125-foot Dhyana Buddha** statue stand as key landmarks, along with the **Amaravathi Heritage Centre and Museum**, which refer to the Buddhist legacy of the town.

## Festivals and Cultural Celebrations

Amaravathi hosted the **30th Kalachakra festival**, attracting Buddhists from all over the world. The site also celebrates Hindu festivals such as **Mahasivaratri** and **Navaratri**, reflecting its multi-cultural identity. Amaravathi remains one of India's most historic Buddhist sites.
