# Daulatabad

## History
Daulatabad Fort, previously known as Deogiri Fort, is a historical fortified fortress located in Daulatabad village near Chhatrapati Sambhaji Nagar, Maharashtra, India. From the 9th to the 14th century, it served as the capital of the Yadavas, briefly as the capital of the Delhi Sultanate from 1327 to 1334, and later as a subsidiary capital for the Ahmadnagar Sultanate from 1499 to 1636. Founded in the 6th century CE, Deogiri was an important trading town on caravan routes connecting western and southern India.

## Architectural Marvel
The fort primarily stands on a conical hill about 200 meters high, showcasing remarkable defensive architecture. Notable features include:

- **Moat**: The moat surrounding the fort, called Khandak, was originally water-filled and studded with crocodiles to enhance security against invasions.
- **Access**: There are only two access points to the fort: a narrow bridge and a long gallery along a gradual slope, designed to limit enemy access.
- **Defensive Mechanisms**: The fort has a single entrance without parallel gates, causing confusion for enemies trying to escape. Barbed spikes on the gate were installed to thwart ram battering war elephants.

## Fortification Phases
The fortification of Daulatabad Fort evolved over the centuries, divided into three main zones:

1. **Balakot**: The innermost circle, featuring original Yadava works, including a deep moat and perpendicular walls enhancing its fortification.
2. **Kataka**: The circular middle fortification built by the Tughluqs, consisting of giant double ramparts, bastions, and a significant Jami mosque from 1318.
3. **Ambarkot**: The outermost circuit wall is elliptical, attributed to Malik Ambar, encircling a major part of the old town, measuring two kilometers from north to south.

## Cultural Heritage
The fort has ancient roots associated with Hindu mythology. 'Devagiri' translates to 'hill of god', possibly relating to Lord Shiva. The fort features remnants of Hindu and Jain temples, reflecting the religious landscape of that era.

## Important Buildings
- **Chand Minar**: Constructed by Sultan Hasan Gangu of Bahmani, this tower drew inspiration from Delhi's Qutb Minar and incorporates Lapis Lazuli and Red Ocher.
- **Chini Mahal**: A VIP prison built by Aurangzeb for the leader of the Golconda Sultanate, Abul Hasan Qutb Shah.
- **The Royal Residences**: Various palatial buildings at different points highlight the history of royalty in the fort.

## Legends and Mythology
The fort is steeped in legends, associating the presence of Lord Shiva with the surrounding hills. The fort's complex design, featuring false gates and misleading paths, adds an element of mystery and deceit, particularly in its historical battles.

## Conclusion
Today, Daulatabad Fort stands as a testament to India's glorious history and architectural excellence. Its ruins, set against a scenic landscape, attract visitors and underscore its significance in Maharashtra's rich cultural heritage.
