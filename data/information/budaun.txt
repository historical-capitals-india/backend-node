# Budaun

## Geography and General Information
Budaun is an ancient town in Uttar Pradesh, India, serving as the administrative headquarters of Budaun district. It is located to the east of the Sot River and about 27 km north of the Ganges, lying in the Rohilkhand region. Budaun is approximately 230 km southeast of New Delhi and 245 km northwest of Lucknow.

## Origin and Archaeological Importance
The name of the city is derived from "Bedamooth," as evidenced by stone inscriptions in the Lucknow Museum. According to the Muslim historian Roz Khan Lodhi, the great Emperor Ashoka built a fort and Buddhist vihara here, naming it "BuddhMau" or Budaun Fort. Local mythology attributes the city's name to Budh, an Ahir prince. Recent archaeological findings have uncovered parts of temples and other post-Gupta period relics in nearby villages like Kheda Jalalpur, dating back to the 7th-8th centuries.

## Historical Heritage
Budaun thrived under the Delhi Sultanate, serving as its capital from 1210 to 1214 CE under Sultan Iltutmish. The city's early history was marked by its conquest by Qutb-ud-din Aibak in 1196, establishing it as a principal northern station of the Delhi Empire. Notable governors from the 13th century, such as Shams-ud-din Iltutmish and his son Rukn-ud-din Firuz, later became emperors of Delhi.

## Architectural Landmarks
Budaun is home to a grand mosque built in 1223 by Shams-ud-din Iltutmish, renowned for its famous dome.

The remnants of medieval structures contribute to Budaun's historical appearance today.
