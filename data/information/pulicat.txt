# Overview of Pulicat (Pazhaverkadu)

Pulicat, commonly known as Pazhaverkadu, is a historical seashore town located in the Chennai Metropolitan Area of Thiruvallur District in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Pulicat lies about 60 km (37 miles) north of Chennai and just 3 km (1.9 miles) from Elavur, situated on the southern side of the gorgeous Pulicat Lake, a shallow saltwater lagoon with a coastline of almost 60 kilometers. Recent developments, including several SEZs and rising land prices, mark a significant economic transformation in the region.

## History

Pulicat has held historical importance since the Portuguese first opened a trade post here under the sponsorship of the Vijayanagar empire, establishing a fort that remained until the Dutch won it over in 1609. Between 1621 and 1665, the Dutch sent 131 slave ships from Pulicat, taking thousands of Indians to their plantations in Batavia. This town was the capital of Dutch Coromandel until 1690, changing hands several times before the British took it in 1825. Pulicat became part of the Madras Presidency, which later evolved into Madras state and, finally, Tamil Nadu in 1968.

## Cultural Heritage

The remains of Pulicat's colonial era are evident in its architecture, which includes an old Dutch cemetery dating back to 1622, maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India. The cemetery features grand tombs with carvings of skeletons inscribed in Dutch. Adjacent to it is the Aadhi Narayana Perumal Temple, a prominent religious spot among the locals. Pulicat Day, celebrated for World Wetland Day on 2nd February, features various events ranging from catamaran races to ecology-related competitions organized by the AARDE Foundation.

## Fort Geldria

Fort Geldria, built by the Dutch East India Company in 1613, was significant as it served as the first settlement of the Dutch Republic in India and the capital of Dutch Coromandel. Named after the province of Geldria in the Netherlands, it was garrisoned by 80 to 90 men and was one of the important fortifications in the region. Unlike other Dutch establishments in India, which were primarily trading posts, Fort Geldria functioned as an administrative center, reflecting the town's strategic importance during the colonial era.

## Natural Beauty and Attractions

Pulicat Lake is an essential part of the region's ecological wealth, hosting numerous migratory birds and diverse marine life. The area's beach attractions, including Elavur, offer perfect views for relaxation and tourism. The Pulicat Museum provides visitors with insight into how ecological and built heritage can coexist harmoniouslyâ€”Pulicat stands as a twin sister to history, balancing nature and culture.

## Conclusion

Pulicat is not just a historic town but also a thriving community that celebrates modern development while honoring its heritage. This unique interplay between history and ecology in Tamil Nadu makes it a notable destination.
