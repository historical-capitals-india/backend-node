# Sigal: A Historical Overview

## Origins and Geographic Significance
Sigal was the capital of the ancient region of Sacastene, a location in the Helmund valley of today's south-west Afghanistan. Sigal had crucial strategic value as it lay on the general eastern-west trade route that connected the ancient world's eastern and western parts. Sigal often appears in historical records and hence receives frequent referencesâ€”most prominently from Isidore of Charax, who described it as an important place in the Sakas territory in the 1st century BCE.

## The Saka Influx
The Sakas were a wandering tribe associated with the Scythians and occupied Sacastene during this period. Their capital was Sigal, where the king had his base. Based on Isidore, Sigal was flanked by important cities like Barda, Min, and Palacenti, thus making it an important seat of administration in the Saka land.

## Connections with Neighbouring Civilizations
Sigal's strategic location was close to the most significant Greek cities: Alexandria of Caucasus and Alexandria of Arachosians, which could ensure cultural exchange as well as trade. Thus, being close to Hellenistic centers made Sigal thrive economically while being a melting pot of influences from Greek and Parthian cultures at the same time.

## Parthian Era
With the Saka influence in decline, the Parthian Empire began to rule over much of what is now Afghanistan, from as far south as Sigal to as far north as Arachosia. Thus, a change in ruling occurred with the integration of Sakas and other indigenous populations into the empire being established.

## Legacy and Decline
Despite its early success, Sigal eventually faltered, with factors like shifting trade routes and political instability. The decline of Saka and then Parthian control reduced Sigal's importance as a political capital. All these pressures from greater empires and regional changes would eventually lead to the city's abandonment.
