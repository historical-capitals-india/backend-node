# Jaunpur

## Historical Background of Jaunpur
Jaunpur is a city deeply embedded in the heart of Uttar Pradesh, steeped in history and cultural importance. Founded by the Ahir/Yadav rulers, it has witnessed many crumbled dynasties over time. Strategically located 228 km southeast of Lucknow, Jaunpur is an essential part of the Purvanchal region.

## Historical Importance
Jaunpur traces its origins to the early periods of Hindu rulers, primarily the Ahirs/Yadavs, with Heerchand Yadav regarded as the first ruler. The city underwent a significant transformation in 1359 when Feroz Shah Tughlaq, Sultan of Delhi, took control and named it after his cousin Muhammad bin Tughluq. A eunuch governor named Malik Sarwar declared independence, under whom Jaunpur became a kingdom, paving the way for the Sharqi dynasty.

The Sharqi dynasty existed from 1394 to 1479 and was a formidable military power in Northern India, frequently challenging the Delhi Sultanate. The zenith of the Jaunpur Sultanate occurred under Ibrahim Shah (1402â€“1440), whose rule extended as far east as Bihar and as far west as Kanauj. This period represents a remarkable convergence of Hindu and Muslim cultures, with communal harmony flourishing among indigenous converts to Islam.

However, in 1493, Sikandar Lodi of the Delhi Sultanate captured Jaunpur, bringing an end to the Sharqi dynasty. Despite significant destruction of monuments, several architectural treasures remain, particularly Atala Masjid and Jama Masjid, which beautifully intertwine Hindu and Islamic motifs.

## Jaunpur Architecture
Jaunpur architecture reflects its historical past through a blend of traditional and creative designs. One notable example is the Atala Masjid, constructed in 1408, characterized by its intricate carvings and expansive architectural structure, typical of Islamic architecture of that era. Jama Masjid, also known as Badi Masjid, features large courtyards and exquisite stonework, showcasing the aesthetic skills of the Sharqi era. Lal Darwaja Masjid stands as a majestic structure, while the old bridge constructed in 1564 during the Mughal era over the Gomti River remains a vital means of transport today.

## Jaunpur Today
Jaunpur serves as the district headquarters and reflects a lively population that mirrors its ancient diversity. The city encompasses 2 Lok Sabha constituencies and 9 Vidhan Sabha constituencies, making it a significant center of regional politics. Jaunpur retains a spirit of resistance, with local leaders like Pandit Badrinath Tiwari leading mass uprisings against British rule during the Revolt of 1857.

The city of Jaunpur is historical in itself, with its past resonating through its architecture, cultural practices, and the enduring legacy of its rulers. Jaunpur remains rich in heritage as it evolves into a modern city.
