# Pataliputra: The Founding of a Metropolis

Imagine yourself standing by the Ganges around 490 BCE as Ajatashatru, the king of Magadha, ordered his army to build a small strategic fort, **Pataligrama**. At this moment, that little fort under Udayin became a prosperous capital by being shifted from Rajgir for its strategic position. It is visualized that in the early days, people from nearby villages would gather in marketplaces exchanging spices, metals, and commodities, giving life to this booming city.

**Did you know?** Legends say the name "Pataliputra" may have significance associated with a tree growing nearby—the **Pataliputra (trumpet flower)** tree, which was in full bloom on either side of the Ganges.

## Pataliputra under the Mauryan Dynasty - Heart of an Empire

In 321 BCE, **Chandragupta Maurya** and his advisor **Chanakya** made Pataliputra the grand capital of the Maurya Empire. Bureaucrats, scribes, and military officials moved around the city, managing one of the world's most extensive empires. It hosted governmental meetings and strategy discussions with delegates from Persia and Greece, as Chandragupta formed alliances and developed diplomatic ties.

## Ashoka's Pataliputra: A Spiritual Renaissance

Under **Emperor Ashoka** (268–232 BCE), Pataliputra became the nucleus for Buddhist teaching and peace movements. After the devastating **Kalinga War**, Ashoka converted to Buddhism and made the city a beacon of enlightenment. Vast Buddhist councils were conducted here by monks and scholars from all over the world.

**Imagine This:** The streets of the city filled with monks and pilgrims, the air alive with chanting and discussions on Buddhist philosophy. See Ashoka himself conducting councils, teaching lessons in compassion and tolerance.

## Architectural Marvels and Inventions

Pataliputra was famous for its architectural grandeur. The Greek ambassador, **Megasthenes**, admired Ashoka's palace, which had Persian and Greek influences. The palace columns had lotus etchings and precious stones. The city's drainage system was unique for its time and prevented flooding. The wooden palisades of Pataliputra extended for kilometers, providing ample defense.

**Take a Closer Look:** Imagine the great court of the palace with gilded walls, carved slats, and an elevated throne upon which Ashoka addressed his court. Walk through the marketplace, noticing the detailed water channels running beneath your feet to drain the water.

## Pataliputra as a Centre of Culture under the Gupta Dynasty

Pataliputra continued to thrive as a center of arts, science, and philosophy during the **Gupta Empire** (320–550 CE). Figures like **Aryabhata** and **Kalidasa** frequented the city to contribute to astronomy and literature. Universities and libraries flourished under the Gupta kings' patronage, fostering research and scholarship. Concepts like zero were accepted, and discussions on planetary orbits and metaphysics were common.

**Step into a Lecture:** Picture yourself in a packed auditorium of students and scholars debating the origins of the universe or studying Aryabhata's original manuscripts on astronomy.

## Decline and Rediscovery: The Lost Glory of Pataliputra

By the 7th century, invasions and a change in the Ganges' course led to Pataliputra's decline. When **Xuanzang** visited, only vestiges of the proud city remained. Despite nature's reclamation of the ruins, British archaeologists rediscovered the remnants of Pataliputra centuries later, unearthing pillars, artifacts, and inscriptions that revealed the city's lost glory.

**Rediscovery in Living Colour:** Imagine sitting across the bridges with some of the first archaeologists arriving in **Kumrahar**, brushing away the soil to reveal Ashokan pillars and structures standing through the centuries. Experience the thrill of unearthing ancient engravings that once adorned this mighty city.

## Legacy of Pataliputra: A Name in History

Although erasable by time, Pataliputra survives in its legacies of governance, spirituality, and science. Its ancient texts, philosophies, and architectural innovations continue to inspire civilizations beyond its borders. Modern-day **Patna** still resonates with history's whispers, reminding us of the grandeur that once was Pataliputra.

**Fun Fact:** The remains of Pataliputra have been named a **UNESCO World Heritage Site**, allowing one to travel back in time to witness its golden splendor.
