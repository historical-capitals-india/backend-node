## Triveni Sangam: The Holy Confluence
The Triveni Sangam is one of the iconic features of Prayagraj, where three rivers—Ganges, Yamuna, and the mythical Sarasvati—meet. This convergence has been considered sacred and is mentioned in ancient literature. It is said to be the site where Brahma, the creator of Hinduism, performed the first yagna, making it one of the most sacred places in Hinduism.

## Ancient Origins and Etymology
The name "Prayagraj" translates to "the king of all sacrificial sites," indicating its high status among India's five holy river confluences. The city traces its roots back to historical times, with references found in texts as ancient as the Rigveda, where it was mentioned as Kosambi during the Vedic period, named by the rulers of Hastinapur known as Kuru. Excavations near Prayagraj have unveiled artifacts dating back to 800 BCE, proving the existence of ancient civilizations around this confluence.

## A Historical Capital Through Empires
From the Maurya Empire to the Gupta dynasty, Prayagraj was an administrative and cultural center. It gained prominence under the Mughals when Emperor Akbar established the grand fort of Ilahabas, which later became known as Allahabad. Akbar's fort, strategically constructed at the confluence, symbolized Mughal authority. It served as a provincial capital during Jahangir's rule in the early 17th century, and by the British era, it became one of the important administrative cities.

## Architectural and Cultural Heritage
Prayagraj is home to various historical monuments, including Allahabad Fort built by Akbar, the Ashoka Pillar, and numerous temples.
