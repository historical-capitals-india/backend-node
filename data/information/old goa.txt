# Old Goa: A Historical Perspective

## Location and Significance
Old Goa (Konkani: Pornnem Gõy; Adlem Gõy; Portuguese: Velha Goa) is a historical city located on the south banks of the River Mandovi, in the Tiswadi taluka of North Goa district, India. The city is rich in history and was once the capital of Portuguese India. With its great architectural and religious significance, Old Goa is a place of substantial heritage.

## Historical Background

### Establishment and Growth
Old Goa was founded in the 15th century by the Bijapur Sultanate as a replacement for the earlier port of Govapuri. Under the Adil Shahi Dynasty, the city rose to prominence as the second capital after Bijapur, featuring a moat, palaces, mosques, and temples.

### Portuguese Rule
The Portuguese captured Old Goa in 1510, making it the administrative seat of Portuguese India. By the mid-16th century, the city’s population had grown to about 200,000, establishing it as a center for the spice trade of the Portuguese East Indies.

### Decline and Abandonment
The city faced several epidemics in the 17th century that drastically reduced its population. By 1775, only about 1,500 residents remained. In 1759, the viceroy relocated to Panjim, marking the beginning of Old Goa's abandonment, although it continued to be the de jure capital of Goa until 1843.

## Etymology

### Names and References
The term "Old Goa" became prevalent in the 1960s, with the panchayat naming it Sé-Old Goa. The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) and India Post refer to it as Velha Goa. It is popularly known as Saibachem Gõy, named after Saint Francis Xavier.

### Difference from Other Places
Old Goa should not be confused with Goa Velha, a neighboring location. Other names referring to Goa Velha include Vhoddlem Gõy and Thorlem Gõy, while the word Gõy can refer to the entire state of Goa.

## Architectural Heritage

### Churches and Convents
Old Goa is home to some of the most renowned churches and convents, including:
