Allahabad, also known by names such as Prayagraj and Ilahabad, is a historic city located in the northeastern state of Uttar Pradesh, India. It serves as the administrative capital of Prayagraj district and is one of the most populated cities in Uttar Pradesh. As of the 2011 census, Prayagraj had nearly 1.53 million residents, ranking as the seventh-most populated city in the state.

## Geography and Sangam

Prayagraj is situated in the south-central region of Uttar Pradesh, covering an area of 365 km². The city lies near the Triveni Sangam, where the mythical rivers Sarasvati, Yamuna, and Ganges meet. This confluence is a significant site in Hindu religion and serves as a major pilgrimage destination, especially during the Kumbh Mela.

## Historical Importance

Prayagraj is an ancient site mentioned in Hindu scriptures, historically known as Prayāga, meaning "place of sacrifice." It was referred to as Kosambi during the Vedic period and remained an important settlement until the Gupta period. The Mughal emperor Akbar established a fortified city here, naming it Ilahabas, which later became Allahabad. In 2018, the city was officially renamed Prayagraj.

## Etymology and Cultural Roots

The name Prayāga has Sanskrit roots, signifying "place of sacrifice." Akbar renamed the city Ilahabas, which was later changed to Allahabad under Emperor Shah Jahan. The name Prayagraj translates to "the king of the five prayāgas," honoring this revered confluence.

## Mughal and British Influence

Prayagraj was a provincial capital under Emperor Jahangir in the early 17th century. During the British era, it held administrative importance as the seat of the North-Western Provinces and was briefly the capital of India.

## Archaeology and Ancient Inscriptions

The city features the Ashoka Pillar, inscribed with edicts from the 3rd century BCE, along with later inscriptions. Archaeological surveys have uncovered evidence of villages around the confluence dating back to 800 BCE, suggesting that the region's antiquity is significant.

## Haven of Religious and Pilgrimage End

Prayagraj is a land of many purificatory rituals and is referenced in all Hindu scriptures, including the Rigveda and Mahabharata. It hosts the great Magh Mela and the largest Kumbh Mela, attracting millions of devotees who come to take holy dips in the Sangam.

## Prayagraj Modern

Today, Prayagraj is an important urban center with a diverse economy encompassing real estate, finance, and tourism. It serves as an educational and administrative hub, housing numerous colleges and government offices. The city is the second most visited tourist destination in Uttar Pradesh, after Varanasi.
