# Rajahmundry: The Cultural Capital of Andhra Pradesh

**Rajahmundry** was officially renamed as **Rajamahendravaram** in 2015 and is a city in the district of **East Godavari**, Andhra Pradesh. Often called the "Cultural Capital of Andhra Pradesh," it is a blend of history, culture, art, and religion. As the seventh most populous city in the state, it serves as a significant economic and cultural center in the region.

## Etymology and Historical Significance

The city's name has changed over centuries, from the archaic **Rajamahendrapuram**, which is Sanskrit for "City of King Mahendra," to the name it was actually named after: the Chalukya king, **Rajaraja Narendra**, who ruled in the 11th century. During its brief periods of Qutb Shahi, Mughal, and Nizam rule, the city was known as **Rājmandrī** to the Indians, which was anglicized by the British into **Rajahmundry**. In 2015, Andhra Pradesh's state government restored its original name, **Rajamahendravaram**, paying homage to history.

## Historical Development: Ancient and Colonial Era

**Maharajahamcheruvu** became Rajahmundry during the period of **Ammaraja Vishnuvardhana I** (919–934 AD) and Chalukya ruler **Rajaraja Narendra** around 1022 AD. The city grew under the **Eastern Chalukyas**, **Cholas**, **Kakatiyas**, and finally into the **Vijayanagar Empire**. The Dutch constructed a fort here in 1602, which the British converted into a central jail. This historic jail campus sprawls over more than 196 acres and is a prominent landmark.

During the British colonial period, Rajahmundry was strategically important as the headquarters of the Godavari district under the **Madras Presidency**. The Godavari district was subdivided in 1925 into **East** and **West Godavari** districts, with Rajahmundry becoming the center of East Godavari. This strategic positioning enhanced its role in political and economic developments across the region.

## Role of Rajahmundry in India's Freedom Struggle

Rajahmundry was a major center for India's independence movement. Reformists and political leaders from Rajahmundry were present at the very first meeting of the **Indian National Congress**, held in Bombay. The venerated reformer and educationist, known as the "Father of Modern Andhra," a zealous campaigner for widow remarriages and women's education, founded the town hall in 1890, which gradually became a hub for like-minded reformists and freedom fighters. Prominent leaders delivered inspiring public addresses; **Bipin Chandra Pal** spoke at "Pal Chowk," and **Annie Besant** inaugurated the **Divya Gyan Samaj** at Alcot Gardens.

## Birthplace of Telugu Language and Literature

Rajahmundry is celebrated by the Telugu people as a significant birthplace of the **Telugu language**. It is renowned for its association with **Nannayya**, the **Ādi Kavi** or first poet of Telugu. He translated the **Mahabharata** from Sanskrit to Telugu along with **Tikkana** and **Yerrana**, laying the foundation for Telugu grammar and script, making the city an important cultural and literary center. The great mass communicator in Telugu literature was **Kandukuri Veeresalingam**, whose novel **Rajashekhara Charitra**—the first novel of Andhra—kicked the city's literary legacy into higher gear.

## Geography and Agricultural Heritage

Geographically, Rajahmundry is located at **16.98° N, 81.78° E**, in the heart of the Godavari districts. The great **Godavari River** runs along its west side, contributing to the agricultural wealth of the area. The fertile delta around the city provides ample opportunity for cultivating paddy, sugarcane, and floriculture, making it a prominent center of agriculture. The **"Rajahmundry Traps,"** part of the Deccan Traps on the banks of the Godavari, have attracted geologists worldwide.

## Climate and Seasonal Features

Rajahmundry experiences a hot, tropical climate. The highest recorded temperature was **52 °C**, noted in May 2002 and May 2007. December and January are generally mild, with temperatures ranging between **27 °C and 30 °C**, making it highly advisable for tourism. The wet season comes with heavy rains associated with depressions in the **Bay of Bengal**, refreshing the landscape.

## Economic and Cultural Vibrancy

Due to its floriculture and heritage, visitors are attracted to Rajahmundry for its cultural importance, natural beauty, and traditional art forms. The city remains an important hub for agriculture and tourist marketplaces, contributing significantly to the economy of Andhra Pradesh through its traditional industries.

## Important Landmarks and Heritage Structures

In addition to ancient forts and palaces, **Rajahmundry Central Jail** is another landmark of the city. Present landmarks include the town hall, monuments dedicated to Telugu literature, and significant sites related to India's freedom movement. Therefore, Rajahmundry is a town rich in both history and culture.
