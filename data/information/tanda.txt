The Bengal Sultanate was first founded in 1352 by Shamsuddin Ilyas Shah and became a strong regional authority in India. For centuries, the Sultanate governed Bengal, with capitals Gauda and Tanda playing crucial roles.

### Transition of Capitals

As the Sultanate evolved, Tanda emerged as an important administrative center. During the rule of the Hussain Shahi dynasty, which succeeded the Ilyas Shahi dynasty, it was recognized that Tanda's strategic location endowed it with governance capabilities, leading to its designation as the capital of the Bengal Sultanate.
