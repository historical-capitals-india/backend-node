# Sagala

## Sagala (Sakala)
Sagala, or Sakala in Sanskrit and Sangala in Ancient Greek, was a major city located in modern-day Pakistan, in the north of the Punjab province. It served as the capital of the Madra Kingdom and was an extremely important location in ancient Indian history. Sagala was one of the towns ravaged by Alexander the Great's expedition in 326 BC, with around 80,000 people staying in the city the night before the invasion. According to the Roman-Greek historian Arrian in his *Anabasis of Alexander*, Alexander had the city destroyed to frighten and deter other cities.

## Historical Background
Sagala is mentioned in the ancient Indian epic *Mahabharata*, indicating that the city has a long historic past. The Saka or Scythians, who likely originated from Central Asia, may have inhabited the city. In the *Mahabharata*, it is described how the women around Sagala were "loose and Bacchanalian," suggesting a complex and exuberant social landscape.

## Geographical Description
Sagala was situated in the Sakaladvipa region between the rivers Chenab and Ravi, in the present-day Rechna Doab.

## Indo-Greek Period
Following Alexander's conquests, Sagala was established as the capital of the Indo-Greek empire by Menander I in the 2nd century BC. During Menander's reign, the city became an important trading center, particularly for silk. His conversations with the Buddhist monk Nagasena led to Menander's conversion to Buddhism, which is documented in the Buddhist text *Milinda Panha*. Under Menander's rule, Sagala became a hub of ideas and culture for Buddhism, where Greek settlers and local people coexisted harmoniously.

## Cultural Significance
The geographer Ptolemy, who wrote in the 1st century CE, described Sagala as a city full of parks, gardens, and markets. The city's skyline was characterized by glorious towers, imposing ramparts, and a royal citadel that echoed its architectural grandeur. The streets of Sagala were bustling with the activities of merchants and artisans, and the bazaars were filled with a variety of goods, including clothes, perfumes, and precious jewels. 

Commercial activity significantly contributed to the flourishing and fame of Sagala in culture and trade. These events left a lasting mark on the historical and cultural life of the region for many centuries. Sagala's blend of diverse influences, ranging from Indian to Hellenistic cultures, beautifully expresses the interconnectedness of the ancient civilizations of South Asia.
