# Mukhalingam: The Ancient Capital of Kalinga

**Mukhalingam**, or more commonly **Srimukhalingam**, is a village panchayat situated within the Jalumuru mandal of Srikakulam district in the Andhra Pradesh state. This place, also called "Kalinganagari" anciently, was the capital of the mighty **Eastern Ganga Dynasty** from the 6th to the 12th century AD. Mukhalingam captures the heritage of the dynasty in its cultural richness and architectural structures. Emperor **Sri Ananthavarma Chodaganga Deva**, one of the significant rulers of the dynasty, shifted the capital to **Caudwara Kataka** after conquering **Utkala** in 1122 AD, marking a historical shift in the dynasty's expanse.

## Geography and Connectivity

Mukhalingam is located on the left bank of the **Vamsadhara River**, about **48 km** from Srikakulam town (the nearest railway station) and about **160 km** from Visakhapatnam (the closest airport). The village lies at an elevation of **28 m (92 ft)** above sea level and has a riverside landscape at **18.5943°N, 83.9635°E**. Due to its good connectivity through **Andhra Pradesh State Highway 106**, the village is connected to neighboring towns such as **Jarjangi**, **Challavanipeta**, and the South Odisha district of **Paralakhemundi**, which increases its accessibility to tourist and pilgrim visits.

## Sacred Temples of Mukhalingam

These three **Śiva temples** were built from the late 8th through the early 11th century at Mukhalingam: **Madhukeswara**, **Someswara**, and **Bhimeswara**. The erstwhile main temple dedicated to Lord **Madhukeswara** was constructed by King **Kamaranaba Deva II** of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty, who was the great-grandfather of Anantavarman Chodaganga. These temples, known for their carvings, facades, and spiritual ambiance, attract devotees and history lovers alike.

## Etymology and Historical Significance

The nomenclature of "Mukhalingam" has extremely deep-rooted historical significance and diversified meanings. One interpretation suggests that "Mukhalingam" was derived from "Mohalingam," a term in Odia/Prakrit, which means "Madhu[ka]linga." Another assumption posits that the term "Mukhalingam" originated in reference to the faceted form of the linga present at the Madhukeswara shrine. The term "Mukha" connotes the word "face" in Sanskrit, Telugu, and Odia. Yet another version asserts that the word "Mudu-Kalingam" is derived from Telugu, translating to "Tri-kalinga," referring to Mukhalingam as the principal city in the ancient region of Kalinga, which was referred to as "Tri-Kalinga" because it comprised three parts.

## Population

Mukhalingam has a total population of **3,022** residing in **837 households**, according to the Census of India 2011. The number of males and females is **1,504** and **1,518** respectively, resulting in a perfectly balanced gender ratio. Among them are **265** children below six years of age, and the overall literacy rate stands at **63.58%**. It is a community where rich cultural traditions are passed from one generation to another, making it highly close-knit and appreciative of education and heritage.

## Culture and Festivals

For several centuries, the temples at Mukhalingam have testified to devotion and renovation. The antiquated structures belong to the late 8th or early 9th century, but later renovation works were executed by the Maharaja of the **Paralakhemundi Estate** in the 17th century. The most sacred ceremony among the activities undertaken in the village is the **Chakratirtha Snana**—an annual holy bath that attracts thousands of pilgrims from Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. This sacred ritual takes place on an auspicious day when devotees come to the Vamsadhara River to seek the grace of Lord Shiva and purify their souls.

## Importance in Andhra Pradesh's History

Mukhalingam is known for its rich history, geographical beauty, and old temples, making it one of the most prized heritage sites in Andhra Pradesh.
