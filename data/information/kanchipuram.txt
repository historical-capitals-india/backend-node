# Kanchipuram

Kanchipuram, also known as Kanjeevaram, is an ancient city in the district of Tondaimandalam in Tamil Nadu, located 72 km off Chennai. Dubbed the "City of Thousand Temples," it boasts intricate temple architecture, including halls with thousands of pillars and towering gopurams. The city is significant for its spiritual importance and its renowned silk saree industry, making it one of India's prominent inland tourist destinations.

## Etymology and Legends
The name "Kanchipuram" originates from "Kanchi," which refers to a local flower, and "puram," meaning city. The term "Kanchi" is associated with the act of worship in the Varadharaja Perumal Temple dedicated to Brahma and Vishnu. The town has been known by several names, including Kanchipedu from Sangam literature and Conjeeveram during British rule. Ghatikasthanam is another term that reflects its historical significance as a center of knowledge and culture.

## Historic Importance
Kanchipuram has been mentioned in ancient texts such as Patanjali's Mahabhasya (2nd century BCE) and the Mahabharata, indicating its long-standing prestige. The city's importance grew during the Pallava dynasty (4th-9th centuries), marked by the construction of monumental temples like Kailasanathar and Vaikunta Perumal, designed to withstand invasions. Xuanzang, the Chinese traveler, visited in the 7th century and documented the city's rich religious and academic life. Subsequent dynasties, including the Cholas, Pandyas, and the Vijayanagara Empire, further enriched Kanchipuram's cultural heritage amidst various invasions.

## Religious and Cultural Importance
Kanchipuram is revered in Hinduism as one of the seven cities that grant moksha or liberation. It is home to significant temples, including the Varadharaja Perumal Temple (dedicated to Vishnu), Ekambareswarar Temple (dedicated to Shiva), and Kamakshi Amman Temple (dedicated to Shakti). The city embodies a rich tapestry of Hindu theological traditions, including Shaivism, Vaishnavism, and Shaktism, shaping its social and economic fabric. The silk weaving industry, particularly Kanchipuram sarees known for their craftsmanship, plays a crucial role in improving the local economy. Kanchipuram is also recognized as one of the most influential Hindu mathas, established by Adi Sankaracharya, attracting scholars and devotees alike.

## Geography and Climate
Kanchipuram is situated along the Vegavathy and Palar rivers, divided into Big Kanchi (home to Shiva temples) and Little Kanchi (home to Vishnu temples). The region's soils are predominantly clay and loam, fostering agriculture. The tropical climate, characterized by distinct wet and dry seasons, supports a rich ecosystem of unique medicinal plants.

## Architectural Heritage
The temples of Kanchipuram are masterpieces of Dravidian architecture, exemplified by the Kailasanathar and Ekambareswarar temples. The intricate stone carvings that adorn the halls and grand gopurams epitomize the devotion and artistic sensibilities of their creators, primarily the Pallavas and Cholas.

## Contemporary Growth
Under the HRIDAY scheme, Kanchipuram has been declared a heritage site to preserve its historical value. This initiative aims to balance tourist traffic with conservation efforts, ensuring that the architectural and religious heritage of Kanchipuram endures for future generations.
