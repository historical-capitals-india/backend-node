# Thiruvananthapuram

## Introduction

Thiruvananthapuram, earlier known as Trivandrum, was the capital of the Travancore Kingdom from 1795 to 1947. This princely state, ruled by the Travancore dynasty, was a major political and cultural hub in southern India. The fact that Thiruvananthapuram was the capital city epitomizes the stability and progressive governance that characterized the Travancore Kingdom in the 18th and 19th centuries.

## Historical Context

### Establishment of Thiruvananthapuram as Capital

In 1795, Thiruvananthapuram became the capital of the Travancore Kingdom after the shift from Padmanabhapuram. This move was made considering geographical advantages, easy accessibility, and favorable climatic conditions for administering the kingdom from Thiruvananthapuram.

### Travancore Dynasty Governance

Under the rulers, especially Maharajah Karthika Thirunal Rama Varma I, the administration focused on modernizing the state. The emphasis on developing infrastructure, education, and public welfare brought relative stability and prosperity to the kingdom.

### British Empire Influence

Despite remaining a princely state, the Travancore Kingdom had a unique relationship with the British. While the British provided an influx of influence in local governance, the royalty maintained a degree of autonomy until India's independence.
